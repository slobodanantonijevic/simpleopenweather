# SimpleOpenWeather
Simple Weather App that I have built for the purpose of showing the junior devs on a local course the relatively basic usage of ConstraintLayout, RecyclerView, Scalable Vector Drawables, Fragments, Retrofit, RxJava, Dagger2 & Architectual Components (ViewModel, LiveData and Room).

The app uses free account of [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

The app is still a work in progress.
