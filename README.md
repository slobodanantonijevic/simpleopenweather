# SimpleOpenWeather
Simple Weather App that I have built for the purpose of showing the junior devs on a local course the relatively basic usage of ConstraintLayout, RecyclerView, Scalable Vector Drawables, Retrofit, RxJava, Dagger2, Butter Knife & Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData and Room).

The app uses free account of [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Technology used

- **Retrofit 2.0**: A type-safe HTTP client, that is used to comunicate with the designated API.
- **RxJava**: A Java VM implementation of Reactive Extensions. For composing asynchronous sequences of code, and implementing a reactive/asynchronous programming concept.
- **Dagger2**: A dependency injection framework. We use it to implement a design pattern with minimal burden of writing the boilerplate code.
- **Butter Knife**: Field and method binding for Android views. To reduce the boilerplate code neede to locate our views and set methods over them.
- **Architecture Components**:
